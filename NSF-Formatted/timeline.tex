\section{Timeline of Activities}
We will immediately recruit the graduate students and the postdoctoral scholar who will be working on the proposed projects with the PIs. The investigators, along with the postdoc, will immediately begin working on the theoretical foundations of the project while simultaneously training the graduate students. Within a year, we expect that each of the students will become familiar with at least one of the proposed problems. The students will also familiarize themselves with data sets associated with the project and demonstrate an ability to generate and test code to implement the associated algorithms (e.g., using Jupyter notebooks). 

Scientifically, we anticipate making steady progress, essentially tackling the problems in each of the sections in parallel, as the update on each topic will influence the other. To test our methods we will, starting in year two, also use real data. For the sensor subset selection we will use our own generated data, as mentioned in the "Collaboration Evaluation". 

In anticipation of participating in the formation of Phase II Institutes, beginning in year 2, we will  engage scientists and engineers from application domains including embedded systems, robotics, and medical sensing in collaborative research.

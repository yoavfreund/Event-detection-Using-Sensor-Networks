Published papers: \cite{knudson2016one, mansour2017recovery, needell2017weighted, SaabIEEEIT, needell2018simple, LybrandSaab2018, iwen2018phase, huynh2018fast, feng2019quantized}, and 4 conference papers \cite{needell2017simple, feng2017quantized, iwen2018phase, iwen2019new}.  {\bf Intellectual Merit:}  \cite{knudson2016one, SaabIEEEIT, feng2019quantized, LybrandSaab2018, iwen2019new} study quantization of compressed sensing (CS) measurements, under various signal, measurement, and quantization models. \cite{huynh2018fast} develops techniques and theory for embedding data into the binary cube while  \cite{needell2018simple} provides a framework for using $1$-bit  measurements for classification. \cite{mansour2017recovery, needell2017weighted} study  the use of prior support information  in CS. \cite{iwen2018phase, iwen2017phase} study phase retrieval. %The works use and develop tools in random matrix theory, mathematical signal processing, and applied harmonic analysis. 
{\bf Broader Impacts: }  Saab disseminated the results through multiple invited talks, and has developed and taught graduate courses on (1) compressed sensing and its applications, (2) applied and computational harmonic analysis, and (3) mathematical methods in data science. He mentored a UCSD undergraduate (now UCLA PhD student), and advised four UCSD graduate students and two postdocs,  some of whom are co-authors. Two  mentees are female, and two are members of under-represented groups.%\hfill\\

{\bf  P. Gerstoft}: 2014--2018; NSF PLR-1246151 (SIO; \$844k); Collaborative Research: Dynamic Response of the Ross Ice Shelf to Wave-induced Vibrations. {\bf Intellectual Merit}: This project (DRIS) investigates the response of ice shelves to ocean wave forcing to (1) infer bulk elastic properties from signal propagation characteristics, and (2) to determine how IG wave and other gravity wave forcing propagates across the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS), and (3) to monitor seasonal variability of the RIS response and icequake activity. In 2014, 16 DRIS broadband stations were installed to acquire data for 2 years. Subsequently, 13 geodetic GPS stations were installed during the 2015 field season recovery of the first yearâ€™s seismic data. Joint processing of the 2016 seismic and GPS data are underway. {\bf Broader Impacts}: Supported 2 postdocs, 2 graduate students. NSF Artists and Writers awardee Glenn McClure produced symphonic and choral works from the DRIS data. The Birch Aquarium at Scripps is developing an Antarctic exhibit featuring DRIS results.

{\bf A. Cloninger}: ``A generalized framework for heterogeneous data fusion without point registration'', (NSF MSPRF, DMS-1402254, 07/2014-06/2017, \$150,000). Publications \cite{mishne2017diffusion,cloninger2018bigeometric,shaham2018provable,cloninger2017spectral, cloninger2017note, cloninger2017prediction,cloninger2016function, downing2017describing, bates2017outcome, katzman2018deepsurv,cheng2017two,cloninger2018people}.

{\bf Intellectual merit:} \cite{mishne2017diffusion,cloninger2018bigeometric,shaham2018provable} study the algorithmic and theoretical aspects of deep learning in manifold contexts and for finding a encoding features that are shared across multiple networks or data sets.  \cite{cloninger2017spectral, cloninger2017note, cloninger2017prediction} study a related question of crafting new embeddings and latent spaces that move beyond the Laplace Beltrami eigenfunctions to embeddings involving predicting external functions, directed networks, and solutions to the wave equation.% all of which can have benefit in the context of aligning embeddings across data sets.  
\cite{cloninger2016function, downing2017describing, bates2017outcome, katzman2018deepsurv} focus on various applications of these frameworks in various medical problems.  And \cite{cheng2017two,cloninger2018people} developed methods for testing whether non-registered heterogeneous data sources were distributionally similar.
{\bf Broader impacts:}
The project in generalizing the notion of heterogeneous data and avoiding heuristic approaches.  This created opportunities for interdepartmental collaborative efforts, continuing collaboration with the investigator's colleagues at the National Institutes of Health, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, and the Center for Outcome Research and Evaluation.  The grant also led to an undergraduate research project that has culminated in a well-cited paper, where the undergraduate was a lead author \cite{katzman2018deepsurv}.


\noindent{\bf P. Pal:} Pal is currently supported by three NSF grants. The most closely related to this project is {\em  (CAREER: Smart Sampling and Correlation-Driven Inference for High Dimensional Signals, ECCS-1700506, 2016-2020 \$500,000)}. This grant has so-far resulted in 5 published papers, and several peer-reviewed conference papers. {\bf Intellectual Merit.} Intellectual Merit: The objective of this project is to develop an integrated theory of smart sampling and information retrieval algorithms for modern sensing systems, and understand their fundamental performance limits. Our results show that by designing structured samplers that exploit the correlation and geometry of the measurements, it is possible to infer parameters with provable guarantees in a highly underdetermined regime. {\bf Broader Impact:} Pal has disseminated results through several invited talks, papers and seminars, and organized special sessions at conferences. She developed and new graduate and undergraduate courses on linear algebra, linear optimization and convex optimization. The PI currently supports 6 Ph.D students, including two female students. She also advises two undergraduate female students from under-served backgrounds as part of ACES scholars program. 

\noindent{\bf Y. Freund:} Supported by NIH grant U19 NS107466 (2018--2023) \$9.7M direct. {\bf Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior}  Collaborative research whose goal is to build detailed models of the mouse brain-stem. {\bf Intellectual Merit}  Freund's groups contribution is the development of a digital atlas and learning algorithms that are used to align the atlas to a stack of brain sections. This atlas defines a coordinate system that is used by neuro-scientists to share experimental results. The first stages of this work were published in~\cite{ChenEtAl2019}. {\bf Broader Impact:} The active atlas will allow neuro-scientists to share and compare their experimental results. Extending the atlas to the human brain can have a major impact on Neurology.

\subsection{Use of a sensor network}
\begin{itemize}
\item Track an EM source in a home based on an ad hoc network. 
\item Estimating foot traffic (as in match point)
\item Localize a speaker in a room
\item Localizing a weak source in a floating network where the sensor locations are unknown. In e.g., The ocean
\item Structural monitoring using 
\item Localizing an acoustic source anywhere in a home using a sensor few sensors in a room. A human can do it. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Broader Impacts}
Sensor networks are an important emerging technology with applications
in retail, manufactoring, security and medicine. These networks
collect vast amounts of raw data, most of which is not relevant to the
task of the system as a whole.

On the other hand, the deployment of such systems places strict
constraints on the power and bandwidth available to each sensor.
Sensors are expected to operate for years on a small battery or by
foraging energy from the environment. A related problem is the
bandwidth, range and energy consumption of wireless communication
protocols, which greatly limit the data-rate sent in an out of each
sensor.
 
Our proposed approach of {\em learning sensor networks} if successful,
will enable a new generation of sensor networks which will imact all
aspect of modern society.

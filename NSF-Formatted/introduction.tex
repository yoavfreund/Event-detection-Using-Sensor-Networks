\section{Introduction}
The fact that humans have {\em two} eyes and {\em two} ears has clear
benefits. Our two eyes provide us with depth perception. Our two ears
allow us to detect the direction from which a sound is coming.

The same holds for artificial sensors. Multiple sensors with
overlapping receptive fields can produce better representations of the
environment. However, to produce such representations, the data
streams generated by the sensors need to be compared and combined. One
approach is to send all of the signal to a center and use a single
computer to combined them. This approach requires high bandwidth
communication and powerful computers and does not scale well to
networks with hundreds or thousands of sensors.

An alternative is {\em pushing computation to the edge}. Instead of
performing all of the computation on a central machine, each sensor
has some computing power which it uses to perform some of the
computation and reduce the amount of information that needs to be
sent. This reduction is not compression as we are not asking for a
reconstruction of the original signal. Instead what we want to produce
is a high-level representation of the environment. For example, the
location of an object, or a count of the people in a particular
area. Computing this high level representation will usually require
much less information from each sensors than a compressed version of
the raw signal.

\section{Intellectual Merit}

\iffalse
We propose a novel approach we call {\em Learning Sensor Networks}.

\rayan{Need to change depending on the name we settle on!}

This approach assumes that sensors are placed at fixed locations and
remain there for a significant length of time.  Each sensor uses {\em
  statistical learning} to model it's environment. It communicates
with neighboring sensors in order to know their models and to
calibrate parameters such as relative location. After an initial
training period, which might last minutes, days or months depending on
the context, the network can distinguish normal from abnormal
behaviour. Based on that ability, it will transmit to the other
sensors only a {\em sketch} (see Section \ref{sec:quant}) which captures the novel, or
salient aspect of the signals.

Learning sensor networks promise much lower energy and bandwidth
consumption than current sensor networks. To realize this potential we
plan to develop new new mathematical models, signal processing methods
and distributed algorithms for computing and combining sketches. Indeed, much of the remainder of the proposal is dedicated to expanding on its intellectual merits, focused on solving some of the challenges that sensor networks present.

The need to reduce communication bandwidth is not new. Sophisticated video compression methods such as H.264 are used in most digital video cameras. However, the goal of such methods is to reconstruct the original video, either perfectly (lossless compression) or approximately (lossy compression). The assumption is that the reconstructed video will be viewed by a human who will make the appropriate determinations. Compression is a channel and the ideal channel is one which transmits the original data unchanged.

Our goal in developing {\em learning sensor networks} is different. We see a sensor network not simply as a channel, but as part of the data analysis pipeline. Each sensor builds a model of the data it receives. If new data conforms to the model, then it is considered {\em uninteresting} and is not transmitted, leaving the communication channels available for more important information. Our ultimate goal is to develop a mathematical theory of communication which is based on notions of {\em statistical significance}, rather than {\em entropy}. Such a theory might become a new way to understand networks that combine sensors, computation and communication.

%Thus, in Section \ref{sec:Framework} we develop our overarching notational framework and describe some motivating applications.  Sections \ref{sec:TL}, \ref{sec:sensorSelection} focuses on optimizing the design and geometry of sensor networks. We anticipate that our work in this direction will develop and use methods from signal processing as well as algebraic results from mathematics \rayan{Piya: Please edit this monstrosity I created :) and expand on it}. \rayan{Peter: Ditto please add your stuff}
%Section \ref{sec:QuantSketch} focuses on developing theory and algorithms for embedding large data-sets collected at the sensors into a much lower dimensional binary cube. The objective is for this compressed binary sketch to contain sufficient information to perform a statistical task of interest. To that end, this work will devise and use methods from applied and computational harmonic analysis, high dimensional geometry and probability, as well as (Kernel) statistics.\rayan{Yoav: Please add your stuff}
